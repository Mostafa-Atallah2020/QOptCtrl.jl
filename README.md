# QOptCtrl.jl

A general package on Quantum Optimal Control.

This project aims at developing a general purpose library for implementing gates in the presence of noise or other physical/hardware restrictions.

A few examples are engineering an arbitrary single qubit gate in the presence of stochastic fluctuation in frequency parameters. Another example is engineering a pulse sequence to effectively decoupe a system of interacting spins. Or, designing an optimum pulse sequence to rotate an ensemble of electrons in the presence of an inhomogeneous magnetic field.
